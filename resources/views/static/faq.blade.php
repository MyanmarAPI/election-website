<h4>MaePaySoh FAQ</h4>
<ol>
<li>			
<p class="question">Q. What is MaePaySoh?</p>
<p>MaePaySoh (“Let’s Vote!”) is an initiative that taps the talent of local Myanmar developers to help voters access essential information for Myanmar’s upcoming general elections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">Q. Why MaePaySoh?</p>
<p>Myanmar’s general elections will be held on November 8, 2015. What do voters need to know about electoral processes, political parties, and candidates? Knowledge and awareness of the electoral process, the political parties, and the candidates is fundamental to ensure informed civic participation.</p>
 
<p>Recent survey research suggests that voter and civic education remain crucial needs. Seventy-six percent of the public does not know that Myanmar’s parliamentary bodies make laws. Only 12% of the public know that the president is elected by the Union Parliament. Eligible voters also report feeling substantially uninformed about many aspects relating to the upcoming elections, including the mechanics of voting: from how the mark the ballot to where and when to vote. Respondents reported feeling least informed about participating political parties and legislative candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">Q. How will MaePaySoh benefit voters?</p>
<p>The MaePaySoh initiative aims to provide non-partisan voter information that voters can use to understand the electoral process and make informed choices. MaePaySoh will do so through a range of mobile and web applications powered by the MaePaySoh API, providing voters access to essential information about elections processes, the political parties, and the candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">Q. What is the MaePaySoh API?</p>
<p>The MaePaySoh Application Programming Interface (API) makes it possible for developers to easily access a public and open source database that contains data sets relevant to Myanmar’s upcoming general elections, and to design and build mobile and web apps, or other digital tools, to help voters access essential elections information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">Q. What kind of information will be available through the MaePaySoh API?</p>
<p>Working together with the Union Election Commission (UEC) of Myanmar, and local civil society organizations Charity Oriented Myanmar (COM) and the Open Myanmar Initiative (OMI), we are compiling a public database of information about the 6000+ candidates for national and state/region parliamentary seats, the 93 political parties contesting the elections, and answers to voters’ frequently asked questions about the functions of government institutions, electoral processes, and how to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">Q. How will apps be disseminated to voters?</p>
<p>Mobile and web applications developed using the MaePaySoh API will be showcased at MaePaySoh.org and available for download on the GooglePlay store. Winning apps will be promoted through social media platforms like Facebook, and used by civil society organizations involved in voter education efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="question">Q. How will MaePaySoh benefit developers?</p>
<p>The MaePaySoh initiative supports local Myanmar developers by providing them with the tools that they need to build compelling, and valuable web services, SMS tools, and Android mobile apps that voters can use to learn more about the 2015 election. Together with local developer communities Phandeeyar, GDG Yangon, and Geek Girls, MaePaySoh delivered a series of technical trainings on topics relating to the development of API-driven applications: MaePaySoh API Design Sprint, Node.Js Tutorial, Building Android Apps with Web Tech, and Facebook Developers Tools.</p>
